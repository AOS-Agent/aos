# AOS Changelog

All notable changes to AOS. Release notes sent via Telegram after each 4am update.

## v0.6.2 — 2026-07-13

Summary: Two-lane release channels — the operator rides `edge` (origin/main, same-day) while friend machines ride `stable` (promoted releases only), so day-to-day churn no longer lands on other people's machines at 4am.

- Added release channels — a machine's `~/.aos/config/channel` (edge|stable) decides which git ref the update path tracks. Absent or unrecognised resolves to `stable`, so every existing machine lands on the safe lane with zero action.
- Added the `stable` git tag as the stable pointer — stable-channel machines update to the tag's commit instead of origin/main. Until the first promotion the tag is absent, and stable gracefully falls back to main so nothing strands.
- Added `aos promote` — verifies the running release has soaked ≥ N days (default 2, `--force` to override), runs ship-check + self-test, prints an explicit plan, then moves and pushes the `stable` tag (a tag-only push, never main) and posts a Telegram note.
- Added `aos channel [edge|stable]` — show or set this machine's channel.
- Changed release-manager `create [ref]` and `activate <ver> [hash]` to build from an arbitrary ref and record an explicit deployed hash, so stable machines deploy the tag commit rather than main HEAD.
- Changed fresh installs to write `channel = stable` explicitly.
- Added migration 023 — normalizes an invalid channel file to `stable` (never overwrites a valid edge/stable choice).
- Added core/lib/channels.py (pure resolution + promotion-guard logic) with 29 unit tests.

## v0.6.1 — 2026-06-30

Summary: Repaired the self-update system on release-converted machines — it had been silently broken since the release-system rollout, generating ~1000 false "cron failed" alerts and never actually applying updates.

- Fixed check-update reporting a cron failure on every run on release-system installs (~/aos is a symlink with no git remote) — this produced nearly 1000 false "cron failed" Telegram alerts. A "nothing to do" check now exits 0, not 1.
- Fixed the `--apply` path being dead code — `check()` never returned the sentinel `apply()` waited for, so `aos update` and the 4am auto-update cron never applied anything, even on git installs.
- Added a release-aware update path — check-update now detects release vs git installs and drives release-system updates through release-manager (create + activate) off the source repo, instead of a git pull against the read-only release symlink.
- Changed phase-2 deploy to be install-aware — it computes changed services from the source repo on release installs (where ~/aos has no .git) and reads the new commit hash from the handoff.
- Changed update state writes to pass values via the environment instead of interpolating them into inline Python, hardening against commit messages that contain quotes.
- Fixed release-manager activate/rollback never switching the ~/aos symlink on macOS — `mv -f` followed the symlink into the read-only release dir ("Permission denied"). They now use a shared `_swap_link` helper (atomic `mv -fT` on Linux, `ln -sfn` fallback on macOS, matching convert()). This means auto-update could not have applied a release on any macOS machine.
- Fixed release-manager's release validator reporting false "fails to parse" warnings — it now parse-checks scripts in memory instead of letting py_compile try to write bytecode into the read-only release dir.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-03-28

System revamp — restructured `core/` for navigability, hardened infrastructure, added tests and documentation.

- Reorganized `core/bin/` into `cli/`, `crons/`, `setup/`, `internal/` — scripts are now self-documenting by location
- Grouped `core/work/`, `bus/`, `comms/` under `core/engine/` — the active intelligence layer
- Grouped `core/reconcile/`, `migrations/`, `integrations/`, `lib/` under `core/infra/` — system plumbing
- Added `core/infra/lib/safe_io.py` — atomic file writes with `fsync`, safe YAML load/dump, atomic JSONL append
- Added `core/infra/lib/log.py` — structured JSON logging (`{"ts":"...","level":"...","source":"...","msg":"..."}`)
- Added `core/infra/lib/rate_limit.py` — token-bucket rate limiter, wired into Telegram sends (1 msg/sec)
- Added `core/infra/lib/validate.py` — validates `operator.yaml`, `crons.yaml`, `bridge-topics.yaml` at startup
- Added `fsync` to `engine.py` atomic writes — protects against power loss, not just crashes
- Fixed unsafe write in `metrics.py` — was the only file using raw `open()` instead of atomic write
- Pinned all service dependencies with `requirements.lock` files — `pip install` no longer grabs latest from PyPI
- Updated `aos deploy` to prefer `requirements.lock` over unpinned `pyproject.toml`
- Added pre-push git hook — 5 checks: Python syntax, Bash syntax, YAML syntax, critical imports, secret scanning
- Converted bridge service to structured JSON logging via shared `get_logger()`
- Added 30 pytest tests covering task CRUD, fuzzy resolution, subtask cascade, context injection, handoffs
- Added README.md to all 6 services, 3 engine directories, and reconcile — each with restart commands and key files
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — one-page system architecture overview
- Added migration 022 — updates instance-side path references for existing installs
- Updated 150+ hardcoded path references across 40+ files
